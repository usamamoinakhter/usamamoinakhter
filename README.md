Entrepreneur, Developer, Product Developer, Mentor and a Consultant determined to make a difference.
I am passionate about technology and how it is impacting our lives and helping us evolve. Currently working with frameworks and technologies like React Native, Angular, Flutter, AWS, Firebase etc.

As an ex-CEO of a young startup I am focused on creating career opportunities and changing lives of the masses. I have already served to clients from around 20 countries. Have worked with multiple businesses in US, Germany, Columbia and Norway and beyond to build stunning and exciting products.
As an individual my goal is to give back to the society and build a better, more connected ecosystem where we can grow together.
